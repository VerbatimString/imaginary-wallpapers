<b>What is Imaginary Wallpapers?</b></br>

Imaginary Wallpapers is a native Android application I developed in 2022 that fetched wallpapers from Reddit's API. The project aimed to provide users with a seamless wallpaper browsing and customization experience.</br>

<b>Key features include:</b></br>

The app was initially available on the Google Play Store. However, due to changes in Reddit's API pricing, I had to remove it. I'm considering re-uploading it in the future, possibly alongside a game I'm developing for my final year project.
